This is the Phone Book (Kotlin) project I made myself.

<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
<p>You will learn a variety of sorting and search algorithms, one of which is recursive. If it is algorithm competence that youâ€™re after, this project is definitely for you.

You suddenly remember you need to call your aunt and wish her a happy birthday, but how do you find her number quickly in a giant phonebook? Write a program that will solve this problem once and for all. Create a phonebook that allows you to find the information you need quickly and easily. Names and numbers, here we come.

Phone Book (Kotlin) is a graduate project.
